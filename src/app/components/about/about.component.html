                    ðŸ«¡ Hi! I am Lourdes, a self-taught web developer with a passion for problem solving. I also have a
                    strong interest in music and UX/UI design, and I firmly believe that in interface design, less is
                    more.

                <h3 class="sobreMouse"><strong>What I do?</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    ðŸ¤“ I use tools like Angular and Bootstrap to bring web pages to life, ensuring they are functional
                    and visually appealing. Furthermore, I leverage my skills as a backend developer to add dynamism to
                    my web creations.
                </p>

                <h3 class="sobreMouse"><strong>Where I go?</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    ðŸ¤© I am committed to lifelong learning, embracing practical problem-solving, and constantly
                    enhancing my logical and design skills. My ultimate goal is to find joy and fulfillment in my
                    passions, which serve as a constant source of inspiration in my life.
